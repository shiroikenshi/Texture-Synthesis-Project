# Image Processing - Texture Synthesis Algorithms
This repository contains texture synthesis algorithms developed in Python on the Google Colab platform. The application implements two texture synthesis algorithms, Inpainting and Super-resolution with a neural network (Real-ESRGAN).

### Development
The project was developed in the form of a report, which was then divided into six parts: abstract, introduction, objective, development, conclusion, and references. Therefore, all the documentation-related content is included in the application's notebook itself.
